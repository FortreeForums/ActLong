# [AP] Activity/Longevity Meters
Inspired by WetWired's vBulletin mod

This addon adds an "activity" and a "longevity" meter to users postbits and profiles.

A cron job runs every Monday at Midnight which resets the activity meters to 0.

Admins can control how many posts are required to fill the activity bar to 100%, the color of the meters, and can disable them from appearing in postbits or profiles.
